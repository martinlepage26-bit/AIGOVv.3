        <h1>AI governance is now a business requirement</h1>

        <p>
            If your organization deploys AI, you’re expected to prove control—not just good intentions.
            Regulators, enterprise customers, and internal audit teams increasingly ask for documented risks,
            clear accountability, defined approvals, and evidence that oversight works in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most expensive time to build governance is after an audit, a procurement review, or an incident.
            A practical governance program keeps you defensible while you keep delivering.
        </p>

    <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
    <section>

        <h2>Why this matters now</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Requirements are moving faster than regulation.</strong>
                Procurement, contracts, and client assurance requests often set standards before laws do.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Auditability is becoming the baseline.</strong>
                Teams must show how AI systems are documented, monitored, and reviewed over time—not just that policies exist.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Accountability has shifted upward.</strong>
                When AI fails, consequences can be legal, financial, operational, and reputational—and responsibility increasingly sits with leadership.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- HOW I SUPPORT -->
    <section>

        <h2>How I support organizations</h2>

        <p>
            I help teams implement AI governance that holds up under scrutiny and still fits how work gets done.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Typical support includes:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mapping AI use cases, ownership, and risk exposure</li>
            <li>Building governance that generates usable evidence, not paperwork</li>
            <li>Preparing for procurement reviews, audits, and regulatory questions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The goal isn’t to slow innovation. It’s to make AI systems understandable, accountable, and sustainable.
        </p>

    <!-- OFFER -->
    <section>

        <h2>My offer covers</h2>

        <h3>Ownership and approvals (RACI + decision paths)</h3>
        <p>
            Define decision rights, required sign-offs, and escalation so accountability is explicit and defensible.
        </p>

        <h3>Inventory, documentation, and decision records</h3>
        <p>
            Maintain a practical view of what AI exists, where it’s used, what it impacts, and why key decisions were made.
        </p>

        <h3>Controls, testing evidence, and audit trail</h3>
        <p>
            Implement controls that can be tested and evidenced—so you can demonstrate governance is operating, not aspirational.
        </p>

        <h3>Monitoring, incidents, and remediation</h3>
        <p>
            Establish ongoing oversight: performance monitoring, issue tracking, incident response, and corrective actions.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-party and vendor governance</h3>
        <p>
            Apply governance expectations to suppliers and tools to support due diligence and defensible procurement.
        </p>

        <h3>Procurement questionnaires and assurance responses</h3>
        <p>
            Produce clear, consistent, evidence-based responses to buyers, auditors, and client security/compliance teams.
        </p>
